      The current warming trend is of particular significance because it is unequivocally the result of human activity since the mid-20th century and proceeding at a rate that is unprecedented over millennia.It is undeniable that human activities have warmed the atmosphere, ocean, and land and that widespread and rapid changes in the atmosphere, ocean, cryosphere, and biosphere have occurred.

      <br>
      One of the reason that lead to this warming trend is carbon dioxide emission. The heat-trapping nature of carbon dioxide and other gases was demonstrated in the mid-19th century. Their ability to affect the transfer of infrared energy through the atmosphere is the scientific basis of many instruments flown by NASA. There is no question that increased levels of greenhouse gases must cause Earth to warm in response.

      Climate change affects every corner of our planet â€“ from the poles to the tropics, and from the mountains to the oceans. People and nature worldwide are already feeling the effects: water supplies are shrinking, extreme weather events increasing in frequency and intensity, forests burning, and coral reefs dying.
      <br>
      <br>
      Governments, companies, cities and communities are coming together to act. We can still escape the worst impacts of climate change, and build a safer future for all.
      <br>
      <br>
      We can also contribute to solving the global warming problem from small things in our daily life like transportation.
